    <p id="review"><b>5/5</b> <i>"Wow! I'm impressed. I've seen Dr. Arnold twice so far and he and his staff are very professional. Um glad to know that Dr. Arnold isn't about the$$$. My 3rd visit, I was supposed to have a tooth extracted and get a few fillings. To make a long story short, when I got to my appointment the nurse took my b/p before the extraction and fillings. I had to reschedule bc my b/p was too high. That really impressed me. Great staff and I felt comfortable. I would recommend. Dr. Arnold Dentistry!"</i></p>
