    <p id="subheading">ROBERT S ARNOLD. DDS - DENTIST IN TEXARKANA, TX</p>
    <hr>
    <br><p id="paragraph">Dr Arnold was born and raised in Fresno California.  His love of dentistry started as a young man in the Boy Scouts of America during a merit badge certification.  After that, he knew exactly what he wanted to do for his adult life.</p>
    <br><p id="paragraph">He completed his undergraduate degree at Fresno State University before going on to earn his DDS degree at the University of the Pacfic in San Francisco-one of the premier dental schools in the United States.  After school, he returned to Fresno where he practiced in his own private practice for the next 17 years before deciding to move to East Texas. Dr. Arnold is one of the best dentists in the Texarkana, TX area.</p>
    <br><p id="paragraph">Dr Arnold is married to the love of his life for more than 20 years and has four wonderful children.  When he is not busy at the dental office (doing what he absolutely loves) or busy with his family, he divides his time between church, and his favorite pastimes.  He has a love of sports and outdoor activities.</p>
    <br><p id="paragraph">You will have a hard time finding a more skilled, friendly and caring dentist anywhere.  Dr Arnold is loved by his staff and his patients.</p>
